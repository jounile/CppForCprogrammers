/* 
 * ShortestPathAlgoritm
 * Implements the mechanics of Dijkstra’s algorithm. 
 * Besides having member fields (has a relationship) of Graph and Priority Queue, an additional ADT maybe required to maintain the parent relationship of the shortest path. 
 *
 * There are 2 basic implementations used for graphs – one is edge lists, and the other is connectivity matrices. 
 * You can decide which to use, but comment on your choice.
